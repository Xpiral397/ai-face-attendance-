# AI Face Attendance System Logic

## Logical Steps

1. **Authentication System**
   - **Student Login:**
     1. Capture face using webcam.
     2. Verify face using a face recognition library.
     3. Prompt for password entry.
     4. Authenticate using both face and password.
     5. Generate JWT token for session management.

   - **Lecturer/Admin Login:**
     1. Enter email and password.
     2. Authenticate credentials.
     3. Generate JWT token for session management.

2. **Dashboard Systems**
   - **Student Dashboard:**
     1. Display personal timetable with live ticker.
     2. Show upcoming classes and notifications.
     3. Provide access to course materials.
     4. Allow face verification for class attendance.

   - **Lecturer Dashboard:**
     1. Display teaching schedule.
     2. Manage student attendance.
     3. Upload and manage course materials.
     4. Track student performance.

   - **Admin Dashboard:**
     1. Manage faculties, departments, and levels.
     2. Allocate lecturers to courses.
     3. Generate and manage schedules.
     4. Monitor system usage and performance.

3. **Academic Management**
   - **Structure Management:**
     1. Add/edit faculties, departments, and levels.
     2. Assign courses to departments and levels.
     3. Allocate lecturers to courses.

   - **Scheduling System:**
     1. Select faculty, department, and level.
     2. Choose course and lecturer.
     3. Allocate time slots, checking for conflicts.
     4. Validate and finalize schedule.

4. **Face Recognition System**
   - **Implementation:**
     1. Use client-side detection for efficiency.
     2. Perform real-time face detection and verification.
     3. Implement anti-spoofing measures.
     4. Optimize performance for low-resource environments.

5. **Attendance System**
   - **Process:**
     1. Capture face for attendance marking.
     2. Verify face against stored encodings.
     3. Record attendance in the database.
     4. Generate attendance reports.
