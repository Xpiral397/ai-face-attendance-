# AI Face Attendance System Structure

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture, coding standards, and modularity guidelines for the AI Face Attendance System. It ensures the codebase is understandable and maintainable by humans and AI.

## Backend Structure

### Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI or Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Face Recognition**: OpenCV and face-recognition library
- **Authentication**: JWT for session management

### Modules
1. **Authentication Module**
   - Handles user login and JWT token generation
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Face verification integration

2. **User Management Module**
   - CRUD operations for students, lecturers, and admins
   - Role-based access control

3. **Academic Management Module**
   - Faculty, department, and level management
   - Course and lecturer allocation

4. **Scheduling Module**
   - Time slot allocation and conflict detection
   - Schedule generation and management

5. **Attendance Module**
   - Face-based attendance marking
   - Attendance records and reporting

### API Endpoints
- **/auth/**: Authentication-related endpoints
- **/users/**: User management endpoints
- **/academic/**: Academic structure management
- **/schedule/**: Scheduling operations
- **/attendance/**: Attendance tracking and reporting

## Frontend Structure

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion

### Components
1. **Authentication Components**
   - Login forms and face capture interface

2. **Dashboard Components**
   - Student, lecturer, and admin dashboards
   - Real-time updates and notifications

3. **Management Components**
   - Academic structure and scheduling interfaces
   - User management and allocation tools

4. **Attendance Components**
   - Face verification and attendance tracking
   - Attendance history and reports

### Pages
- **/login**: User login page
- **/dashboard**: Main dashboard for all roles
- **/manage**: Admin management interface
- **/schedule**: Scheduling and timetable view
- **/attendance**: Attendance tracking and history

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- **Consistency**: Follow consistent naming conventions and code style
- **Comments**: Use clear and concise comments for complex logic
- **Modularity**: Break down code into reusable functions and components
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging

### Backend Standards
- **RESTful API Design**: Follow REST principles for API endpoints
- **Security**: Implement authentication, authorization, and data validation
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and response times

### Frontend Standards
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across devices
- **Accessibility**: Follow ARIA guidelines and semantic HTML
- **State Management**: Use React hooks and context for state management

## Modularity and Reusability
- **Component Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different parts of the application
- **Service Layer**: Implement a service layer for business logic
- **Utility Functions**: Create utility functions for common operations

## Future Considerations
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle increased load and user base
- **Extensibility**: Allow for easy addition of new features and modules
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all modules and components
